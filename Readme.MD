About Me

Hi, I'm Manish, a backend engineer passionate about building scalable applications. My top skills include JavaScript, React, Laravel, PHP, Express, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, and Python. I love working on e-commerce platforms, food delivery, and blog applications.

Outside coding, you’ll find me reading and writing. I’m always open to collaboration—email is my preferred way to connect.
